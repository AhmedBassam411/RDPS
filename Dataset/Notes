The dataset contains 1,858 instances, each representing a unique executable file, and is described by 50 distinct features.
These features are derived from a comprehensive dynamic analysis performed in a sandbox environment (like Cuckoo Sandbox) and are grouped into several logical domains. Understanding these domains is key to appreciating the depth of the data used for training.
